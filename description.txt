NPCUtils adds some tools for modders to make modding easier. 

Namely:
- BestiaryHelper (through bestiaryEntry.AddInfo), changing creating bestiaries to one line, automatically generating & using localization
- AutoloadBannerAttribute, which automatically loads a banner tile and item for the given ModNPC it's attached to
- AutoloadCritterAttribute, which automatically loads a critter & sets the given ModNPC as a critter
- LootExtensions, which adds a ton of extensions onto ILoot and LeadingConditionRule for ease-of-use.

Everything has extensive XML documentation - just make sure to use the pdb, dll and xml which can be found in the GitHub's releases.
